This repository contains implementations for inference and learning in probabilistic graphical models from scratch. Detailed code and [tutorials](https://github.com/anmold-07/Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-from-Scratch/blob/master/Python/Learning%20%26%20Inference%20in%20Discrete%20(Multi-valued%20RVs)%20Bayesian%20Networks.ipynb) are provided for both Directed and Undirected Graphical Models, in MATLAB and Python. Additional algorithms may be added in the future.
